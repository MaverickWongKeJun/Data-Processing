\f0\fs24 \cf2 In this project, the goal is to apply existing machine learning techniques to identify the\
best approach for detecting phishing attacks in blockchain transaction networks.\
\
I will be using existing datasets on Kaggle for the data required for this project. For the\
models, as I foresee limited data available, I will mainly be using simple models such as\
regressions, random forest and XGBoost. Deep learning models like neural networks\
may be experimented to identify effectiveness.\
\
The biggest foreseeable challenge would be obtaining suitable datasets, and significant\
pre processing steps will have to be taken to ensure balanced datasets, handling of\
missing values appropriately and outlier management.\
\
On top of training the models, I want to attain a better understanding of the underlying\
theories behind the machine learning models used and understand their effectiveness,\
or lack thereof, in detecting phishing attacks.\
\
Furthermore, beyond the machine learning models, I want to conduct further exploratory\
analysis to uncover any dominant characteristics present in fraudulent transactions to\
inform myself of what are the most common signs of phishing.}
